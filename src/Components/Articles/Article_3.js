          Flying on "Empty"
        </h3>

        <p>On the night of 24th August 2001, there was a fully-loaded Airbus A330 with 306 people on board that ran out of fuel in the midst of the Atlantic Ocean. How could a fully computerized airliner suffer such a catastrophic failure? This article tells about Air Transat Flight 236.</p>
        <p>On 23 August 2001, Pearson International Airport in Toronto seemed busy. Air Transat was a charter company that was growing to become the largest airliner company in Canada. This summer brought some oil business travelers to the holiday business atmosphere. Air Transat Flight 263 was bound for Lisbon. Most of the passengers were Canadians visiting Europe and some Portuguese were heading home.</p>
        <p>At 19:34, the flight, a twin-engine modern A330, was flown by a young co-pilot, Dirk de Lagar, and an experienced captain, Robert Piche. One aviation specialist, Yvan-Miville Des Chenes, said, “Captain Robert Piche is somewhat out of the ordinary.”</p>
        <p>The flight deck of the A330 was ultra-modern. Flight computers were connected to hundreds of on-board sensors that constantly monitored the onboard operations of the plane.</p>
        <p>At 20:00, the computers were set for a smooth take-off by Flight 236. At 20:20 on the 24R runway, with a crew of 13 and 306 people on board, the A330 took off as usual. It was delayed by 10 minutes due to an Air Canada A320.</p>
        <p>The weather forecast for the Atlantic crossing was good. Everything ran smoothly on the flight deck apart from a small adjustment in the route. To avoid a conjunction, the air traffic controller directed the flight 60 miles south of its original route. It was a minor alteration, but it played a crucial role later. Passengers settled down for the long crossing.</p>
        <p>Every 30 minutes of crossing the Atlantic, the pilots checked their position and fuel consumption against their flight plan. Some procedures, such as fuel calculations, were made by hand in the cockpit instead of by computers. By comparing the amount of fuel in the tanks, the pilots kept their eye on fuel consumption. At this time, the fuel calculation was normal.</p>
        <p>For the first 5 hours, everything was routine. After 5 hours, the pilots got a warning signal that revealed a low oil temperature and high oil pressure on engine number 2. This warning was the first step in the crisis. The oil temperature in engine number one was normal, but it was slightly high in number two. It was quite an unusual reading. The pilots were puzzled. The first officer could not see any solution in his flight manual. The crew contacted the Air Transat maintenance company, but the ground crew had no immediate solution. The pilots had to work it out themselves. Because of the very unusual oil temperature reading, the pilots decided that it might be a computer error. The pilots continued to monitor the oil levels.</p>
        <p>Air Transat Flight 236 continues on track. At 05:26, about 20 minutes later, a new warning flashes: "FUEL IMBALANCE WARNING!" The captain has never seen this warning before. In the Airbus A330, most of the fuel is in the large tanks in the wings. The computer detects that the fuel level in the right tank is significantly lower than in the left tank. The pilots consult the Airbus aircraft manual, which has information about a special cross-feed valve. After processing the cross-feed, the fuel is transferred from one tank to the other. But before opening the cross-feed, the pilots must confirm that the fuel imbalance is not caused by a fuel leak. However, the pilots didn't identify any indication of a fuel leak.</p>
        <p>The first officer finally switches on the wing cross-feed valve. When the pilots initiate the cross-feeding procedure, it restores the fuel imbalance. However, the situation doesn't correct itself. Unbeknownst to the pilots, there was a major fuel leak in engine number 2. Flight 236 is 300 kilometers away from Newfoundland, in mid-Atlantic, 39,000 feet over the ocean. Air Transat Flight 236 is in trouble. The pilots are unaware that engine number 2 is losing fuel continuously due to the leak. The flight computer system has thrown a series of warnings, but the pilots still believe these are computer errors. Even the most experienced captain has not encountered something like this before and believes it to be a computer problem. A pilot of Airbus A330, David Lynch, said "The Airbus monitoring system has hundreds of sensors. We can sometimes be affected by those warnings." The pilots didn't receive any immediate indication that suggested a fuel leak.</p>
        <p>The first officer reveals that the fuel is very low in both engines and that it looks like a fuel leak. The captain doesn't believe it and asks to check again. The co-pilot discovers the alarming difference. According to the gauges, all the tanks in the right wing are significantly lower than those in the left. The situation is now serious. Captain Robert Piche calls the flight attendant and asks her to go to the left wing with some flashlights and report back if she sees any streams or leaks. In daylight, fuel pouring from the back of the wing would have been clearly visible, but at night, it's impossible to see with just a torch.</p>
        <p>The crew realizes that the situation is not improving and that it's becoming increasingly serious. If the computer is correct, the amount of fuel remaining in the Airbus is not enough to make it to Lisbon. Captain Piche is now forced to divert the flight. He asks de Lagar to call ATC and ask for the nearest airfield. The nearest runway is over 300 kilometers away, but the fuel remaining should be enough to reach Lajes military airbase, which has the largest runway. </p>
        <p>The captain, Robert Piche, was refused to declare an emergency. He still believed it was a computer error. Air Transat Flight 236 continued flying for the next 25 minutes, with everything in the cabin appearing normal. However, in the cockpit, the fuel readings were getting worse. According to the fuel gauges, the plane was using fuel much faster than normal. The captain had no choice and declared a fuel emergency at 05:48. But at 06:13, less than an hour after the first fuel alarm, the air hostess served their passengers bed coffee. The right engine ran out of fuel and cut out. The captain didn't believe this and gave maximum thrust to engine number one, but the Airbus wouldn't fly at 39,000 feet with only one engine. They had to descend quickly. Lajes Airport in the Azores could see Flight 236 on their primary radar. For the next 10 minutes, the twin-engine Airbus continued on its course with only one engine. The captain still believed that his computer may have been partially faulty.</p>
        <p>At 06:26, 13 minutes after the right engine cut out and with 160 kilometers still to go, the left engine began to fail. The first officer de Lagar transmitted the following message to ATC: "MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY, we have lost both engines due to fuel starvation, we are gliding now!" One of the most sophisticated airliners of the modern era, carrying 306 passengers and crew, was now nothing more than a glider slowly descending towards the ocean. The first officer read the list of functions they had lost due to the engine cutoff: no blue and yellow hydraulics, no antiskid, no reverse thrust, no rudder trim, and no ASCAF. With the loss of engines, their electrical system would also lose power as the generators stopped running. However, there was a small device called a ram air turbine (RAT) that would deploy near the wing. This small propeller spun due to the wing's movement and provided limited electrical and hydraulic systems to run the aircraft.</p>

        <p>The first officer reveals his calculation: from 30,000 feet, descending 2,000 feet per minute, the plane will reach the Atlantic in 13 to 14 minutes. Without power, the plane loses 1,000 feet for every 5 kilometers. It can reach the Azores if the pilot doesn't make any mistakes, otherwise, he will have to make a forced landing into the water.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Air Transat Flight 236 is now adrift without fuel over the Atlantic, and their initial calculations show that the plane won't make it to Lajes Airport. Captain Piche must follow standard emergency procedures for a passenger jet over water. He told the air hostess to prepare the cabin, which is slowly losing pressure due to the loss of engine power. The air hostess distributes life jackets.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If the Airbus A330 has to make a forced landing, the chances of survival are low. Airplanes with low-mounted tails do not have good floatation design, because one of the first parts of the plane to hit the water is the tail, which can be sheared off. In 1996, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 ran out of fuel off the coast of East Africa. The video footage reveals what happens when a large jet tries to make a controlled landing on water. Of the 179 people on board, only 50 survived. If Air Transat Flight 236 has to carry out the same maneuver, the chances of survival are very low.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before reaching the Azores 109 kilometers away, the pilots face a long and difficult task. They need to keep the plane gliding for more than 15 minutes to reach the Azores. Lajes Airport is also preparing for the worst, sending the runway heading and link to Flight 236. The runway is 10,065 feet long.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 6:37 on the ground, the emergency services are preparing for the crash landing of the fully loaded airliner. With 20 kilometers to go, the crew must prepare for the most dangerous part of the operation: landing their plane in one piece on the runway without room for error.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Eight miles away from the runway with unlimited visibility, the pilots still can't see the runway. Without power, they have only one chance for landing. If they miss or overshoot the runway, the results could be catastrophic.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now, the pilots have the runway in sight. Captain Robert Piche instructs his co-pilot not to extend the landing gear until the last minute. The pilots struggle to lose height and speed for the landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As they approach the runway, their speed increases dangerously. If they're too fast, they will run off the runway. With no engine and no flaps, the ideal approach speed for an A330 is 170 knots, but the speed of Air Transat Flight 236 is 220 knots - too fast! However, the runway is very long, and Captain Piche now performs a difficult series of maneuvers to slow down the plane for landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew lines up the twin Airbus for the final approach. The landing gear is lowered and locked. At 4,000 feet, the speed is 195 knots, at 3,000 feet, it's 197 knots, at 2,000 feet, it's 200 knots...</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The de Lagare alerted the cabin. V/s 3000 fps. It is also too fast. Speed is increasing. It is 203 knots. 1000 feet 201 knots. But even if the crew gets their plane on the runway, they face further problems. Without engines, normal procedures for braking are severely restricted. The danger is far from over.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 06:46, the pilots must land the plane without power and somehow get it to stop. The Airbus hits hard at high speed. Captain Piche tries to keep the nose down. After bursting 8 tires, the plane finally comes to a stop in the middle of the runway.</p>

        <p>Piche and Lagar had flown their Airbus without power farther than any passenger jet in history, and as news of their remarkable achievement spread around the world, they were hailed as heroes. At the Air Transat press conference in Montreal on August 28, 2001, Captain Piche and First Officer Dirk de Lagar were awarded. However, after the success, disturbing questions remained: Why had a highly sophisticated Airbus run out of fuel? What exactly had happened to Flight 236?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>An accident investigation was immediately launched by Canadian, Portuguese, and French authorities and was handed over to the G.P.I.A.A. Initial checks confirmed that all the fuel tanks in Flight 236 were empty, but losing more than 70 tons of fuel in such a short time would have required a major leak. Engineers examined the fuel systems and found the problem was just with the right engine.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The investigators began checking Air Transat's maintenance records and discovered that on August 19, five days before the flight, the right engine had been removed for maintenance and a replacement unit from Rolls Royce had been installed. However, when they examined the air locks for the engine, they made a shocking discovery: this was not a case of poor design or maintenance. Rolls Royce had supplied the engine without a hydraulic pump assembly, and Transat mechanics had replaced it with parts from an older engine, which didn't fit properly. The pipes had been rubbing together for five days until midway over the Atlantic.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As the investigators questioned Air Transat mechanics, they found more disturbing evidence. The chief mechanic testified that he had replaced the hydraulic pump assembly from an older A330, and the company had decided that the aircraft must go back into service and couldn't wait for the missing parts. The replacement part was different from the original part by a few millimetres, but the difference nearly caused a crash 106 miles away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A few days after the accident, Air Transat CEO Michel Lemay apologized for the faulty maintenance. The investigators now turned their attention to the cockpit, and at G.P.I.A.A. headquarters, both pilots were interviewed. Key questions about what happened on the flight deck remained unanswered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Transport Canada investigation into Air Transat Flight 236 discovered that maintenance errors were responsible for the fuel leak, and Air Transat accepted responsibility. The focus then turned to the flight deck and the performance of the crew. What role did they play in the fuel leak?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When the crew turned on the cross feed valve, fuel transferred from the left wing tank to the right wing tank, causing a loss of 70 tons of fuel in less than 30 minutes. They failed to close the cross feed valve, causing further loss. In the days after the accident, Captain Robert Piche and Dirk de Lagar were questioned in detail about the accident.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Once the pilots calculated the high rate of fuel loss, they should have suspected a fuel leak. By the time they suspected the leak, their options were severely limited. Captain Piche believed for a long time that he was facing a computer error. When both engines stopped, he had to accept that the fuel alarms were genuine.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The technological complexity of modern aircraft is meant to make them safer and more reliable, but in this case, the discrepancy of replacing parts led to a fuel leak. These errors had huge consequences only because the air traffic control led the plane 60 miles south of its actual course. The Portuguese investigation remains unpublished, and Airbus blames the pilots for mishandling the plane. However, Captain Piche and Lagar get back in the cockpit again.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In August 2002, they received one of the highest honors from the airline pilots association for the longest glide ever recorded in a passenger airliner (136 nm).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After the accident, Airbus modified the checklist in case of a fuel imbalance. From now on, the computer will check the fuel on board against the flight plan. Rolls Royce now supplies the hydraulic pump assembly along with the engine and spare parts. Regardless of the circumstances, Captain Piche saved the lives of 306 people.</p>
