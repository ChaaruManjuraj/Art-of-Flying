          Flying on "Empty"
        </h3>

        <p>On the night of 24th august 2001, there was a fully loaded Airbus A330 and 306 people on board, which ran out of fuel in the midway of the Atlantic Ocean. How could a fully computerised airliner suffer such a catastrophic failure? This article tells about Air Transat Flight 236!</p>
        <p>On 23 August 2001, Pearson International Airport, Toronto, seems busy. Air Transat is a charter company which is growing to become the largest airliner company in Canada. This summer brings some oil business travellers to the holiday business atmosphere. Air Transat flight 263 is bound for Lisbon. Most of the passengers are Canadians visiting Europe and some Portuguese are heading home.</p>
        <p>At 19:34, the flight, a twin engine modern A330 is fled by a young co-pilot Dirk de Lagar, and an experienced captain Robert Piche. One of the aviation specialist Yvan-Miville Des Chenes said “Captain Robert Piche is somewhat out of the ordinary”.</p>
        <p>The flight deck of the A330 is ultra-modern. Flight computers are connected to hundreds of on-board sensors which constantly monitor the on-board operations of the plane.</p>
        <p>At 20:00 night the computers are set to smooth take-off by Flight 236. At 20:20 on the 24R runway, with a crew of 13 and 306 people on board, A330 took off usually. It was delayed by 10 minutes due to an Air Canada A320.</p>
        <p>The weather forecast for Atlantic crossing is good. Everything runs smoothly on flight deck apart from the small adjustment in the route. To avoid conjunction the air traffic controller directs the flight into 60 miles south of its original route. It’s a minor alteration. But it plays a crucial role later. Passengers settle down for the long crossing.</p>
        <p>Every 30 minutes of crossing the Atlantic the pilots check their position and fuel consumption against their flight plan. Instead of computers some procedures like fuel calculations are made by hand in the cockpit. By comparing the amount of fuel in the tanks the pilots keep their eye on the fuel consumption. At This time the fuel calculation is normal.</p>
        <p>For the first 5 hours everything is routine. After 5 hours the pilots get a warning signal that reveals low oil temperature and high oil pressure on engine number 2. This warning is the first step in the crises. Oil temperature in engine number one is normal but in number two is slightly high. It is quite an unusual reading. The pilots are puzzled. The First officer cannot see any solution in his flight manual. The crew contacts the Air Transat maintenance company. The ground crew has no immediate solution. The pilots must have worked it out by themselves. Because of the very unusual oil temperature reading the pilots decided that it might be a computer error. The pilots keep monitoring the oil levels.</p>
        <p>Air Transat Flight 236 continues on track. At 05:26, about 20 minutes later, a new warning that is “FUEL IMBALANCE WARNING!” Flashes. The captain has never seen that before. In Airbus A330 most of the fuel is in the large tanks in the wings. The computer detects that the fuel level in the right tank is significantly lower than the left. The pilots consult the Airbus aircraft manual which has the information of special cross-feed valve. After processing the cross-feed, the fuel gets transferred from one tank to the other. But before opening the cross-feed the pilots must confirm that the fuel imbalance is not caused by the fuel leakage. But the pilots didn’t identify the indication of the fuel leak.</p>
        <p>The First officer finally switches on the wing cross-feed valve. When the pilots commence the cross-feeding procedure it restores the fuel imbalance. But the situation is not correcting itself. Unknown to the pilots, there was a major fuel leak in the engine number 2. Flight 236 is 300 kilometres away from the new west land, In mid Atlantic, 39,000 feet over the Atlantic from 300 kilometres from land, Air Transat Flight 236 is in trouble. Unknown to the pilots, engine number two is losing the fuel continuously by leakage. The flight computer system has thrown a series of warnings. But the pilots still believe that they are computer errors. Even the most experienced captain has not seen something like that before. Captain believes that it is a computer problem. A pilot of Airbus A330 David Lynch said “the systems of airbus monitor, it has a hundreds of sensors. We can be affected by those warnings sometimes.” The pilots don’t receive any immediate indication which suspects the fuel leak.</p>
        <p>First officer reveals that the fuel is very low in both the engines and that It looks like a fuel leak. Captain wouldn’t believe that. He asked to check again. The co-pilot discovers the disturbing difference. According to the all the gauges all the tanks in the right wing are weigh below the left one. Then the situation is series. Captain Robert Piche calls the air hostess and asked to go to the left wing with some flashlights and report him if she see anything like stream or leakage. In daylight the fuel pouring at the back of the wing would have been clearly visible. But in the case of night with the help of the torch it is impossible to see.</p>
        <p>The crew evidently realised that the situation was not improving. Their circumferences are becoming too serious. If the computer is correct the amount of fuel remaining the airbus no longer to make it into Lisbon. Now captain piche is forced to divert his flight. He asked de Lagar to call the ATC and ask for the nearest air field. The nearest runway is over 300 kilo meters away. The fuel remaining Lajes military airbase with the largest runway should be within reach.</p>
        <p>The captain Robert piche was refused to declare the emergency. He still believes it is a computer error. Air Transat Flight 236 continues flying itself for next 25 minutes. Everything in the cabin seems normal. But in the cockpit the fuel readings are getting worst. According to the fuel gauges the plane is using fuel much faster than normal. The captain has no choice. He declares the fuel emergency at 05:48. But at 06:13, less than an hour from the first fuel alarm, the airhostess serve their passengers bed coffee. The right engine runs out of fuel and cuts out. The captain doesn’t believe this one. He gave maximum thrust on engine number one. In one engine the airbus wouldn’t fly at 39000 feet. They must descend quickly. In Lajes Airport, Azores, they can see the flight 236 at their primary radar. For next 10 minutes the twin engine airbus continues on its track by remaining one engine. The captain still believes that his computer may be partly faulty.</p>
        <p>At 06:26 13 minutes after the right engine cuts out but 160 kilometres still to go, the left engine begins to fail. The first officer de Lagar’s transmission to the ATC is like this, “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY we have lost both engines due to fuel starvation, we are gliding now!” One of the most sophisticated airliner of the modern era carrying 306 passengers and crew now nothing more than a joint glider getting studiedly down towards the ocean. The first officer reads the list of function they lost due to the engine cut-off, they don’t have the blue and yellow  hydraulics, no antiskid, no reverse thrust, no rudder trim, no ASCAF…. with the loss of engines our electrical system will loss the generators are don’t run. So there is no power on the airplane. There is a small device called ram air turbine (RAT), it will deploy near the wing fearing, it’s a small propeller. It spins due to the wing. That small propeller will give limited electrical and hydraulic systems to run the aircraft.</p>

        <p>The first officer reveals his calculation, from 30000 feet, descending 2000 feet per minute; the plane will drop to the Atlantic in 13 to 14 minutes. Without a power the plane loses 1000 feet for every 5 kilometres. It can reach the Azores if the pilot doesn’t make any mistake! Or else he has to make a force lading into the water.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Air Transat flight 236 is now drifting without fuel over the Atlantic and their initial calculations show that the plane doesn’t make it into Lajes Airport. Captain Piche must fallow standard emergency procedure of a passenger jet over water. Piche told the air hostess to prepare the cabin. The cabin is slowly pressurising. The loss of the engine power, it means to the cabin is slowly pressurise. Airhostess distributes the life jackets.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If airbus A330 has to make the force landing, the chances of survival are weak. The airplanes having low mounted tails do not have the good boating design. Because one of the first interviewers of water is tail, the tail can be rebred off. In 1996, Ethiopian airlines Boeing 767 was ran out of fuel at the Cost of East Africa. Its video footage revels what happens when a large jet want to make the controlled landing on water. Of the 179 people on board, only 50 survived. If Air Transat Flight 236 wants to carry out of same manure, the chances of survival is very less.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before 109 kilometres before they reach the Azores, the pilots faces long and difficult manure. They need to keep the plane gliding for more than 15 minutes to reach the Azores. At Lajes Airport they are also preparing for the worst. They send the runway heading and link to the Flight 236. The runway is 10,065 feet long.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 06:37, on the ground, the emergency services preparing for the crash landing of the fully loaded airliner. With 20 kilometres to go, the crew must prepare for the most dangerous part of the operation, getting their plane on the runway with one piece. There is no room for the error.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Until 8 miles away from the runway with the unlimited visibilities, the pilots can’t see the runway. Without power the pilots have only one chance to the landing. If they miss or overshoot the runway, the result could be catastrophic.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now the pilots have their runway in sight. Captain Robert Piche instructs his co-pilot to not extend the landing gear until the last minute. The pilots struggle to lose height and speed for the landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As they approach the runway, their speed increases dangerously. Too fast and that can be ran off out of the runway. No engine, no flaps, ideal approach speed of A330 is 170 knots but the speed of the Air Transat Flight 236 is 220 knots. It is too fast! But the runway is very long. Captain Piche now performs the difficult series of manures to slow down the plane for landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew join up the twin airbus to the final approach.  The landing gear is downed and locked. At 4000 feet 195 knots, 3000 feet 197 knots, 2000  feet 200 knots….</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The de Lagar alerted the cabin. V/s 3000 fps. It is also too fast. Speed is increasing. It is 203 knots. 1000 feet 201 knots. But even if the crew get their plane on the runway, they faces further problem. Without engines the normal procedures for breaking is severely restricted. The danger is far from the manure.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 06:46, the pilots must land the plane without the power and somehow get it to stop. The Airbus hits hard at high speed. Captain Piche tries to hold the nose down. After bursting 8 tyres the plane finally stops at the middle of the runway.</p>

        <p>Piche and Lagar had flown their Airbus without a power farther than any passenger jet in history. At news as their remarkable achieve spread around the world. They found themselves as real heroes. At Air Transat Press Conference, Montreal, 28th August 2001, Captain Piche and First officer Dirk de Lagar was awarded. But after the success, disturbing questions are remained. Why had a highly sophisticated Airbus run out of fuel? What exactly had happened to Flight 236?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Away from the cabin an accident investigation begins immediately by Canadian, Portuguese and French authorities. This case is handover to the G.P.I.A.A. Investigation. Initial checks quickly confirm that all the fuel tanks in the Flight 236 are empty. But to lose more than 70 tons of fuel in such a short space of time meant to have had a major leak. Engineers examine the fuel systems such perform well as the fuel links. It is just by the right engine.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The investigators begin checking the Air Transat maintenance records. They discover that on the 19th of August, five days before the flight, Air Transat had removed the right engine for maintenance and installed the replacement unit by Rolls Royce. But as they analyse the air locks for the engine, they discover the shocking mistake! This was not a case of to design all the maintenance.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Rolls Royce had supply the engine without the hydraulic pump assembly. To overcome this, Transat mechanics replace the parts from an older engine. But it didn’t fit properly. The pipes have been rubbing together from the five days, until midway over the Atlantic.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As investigators questioned Air Transat mechanics, they found more disturbing evidence. The chief mechanic testified that he affirmed that he had replaced the hydraulic pump assembly from an older A330. The company decided that the aircraft must go back into service. It couldn’t wait for the missing parts. That should go back with the substitution.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The replacement part is different from the original part by few millimetres but the difference nearly cause by 106 miles.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A few days after the accident Air Transat chief Michel Lemay apologies for the faulty maintenance. Investigators now turn their attention to the cockpit itself. At G.P.I.A.A. headquarters both pilots are interviewed. Key questions remained unanswered. Questions about what happened on flight deck.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The transport Canada investigation about Air Transat Flight 236 discovered that the maintenance errors that meant to the fuel leak. Air Transat had accepted the responsibility. The focus now turns to the flight deck, the performance of the crew. What part would they play at the fuel leak?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When the crew turn on the cross feed valve the fuel transfers to the left wing tank to the right wing tank. This had caused the loss of 70 tons of fuel in less than 30 minutes. They fail to close the cross feed valve and prevent further loss. In the days after the accident, captain Robert Piche and Dirk de Lagar were ask in detail about the accident.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Once the pilots calculated the high rate of fuel loss, they should have suspected the fuel leak. By the time they suspected the fuel leak, their options are severely limited. Captain Piche believed for a long time that he is facing the computer error. When both the engines are stopped, they he had to accept that the fuel alarms are genuine.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The technological complexity of modern aircraft is to make them safer and more reliable. Discrepancy of replacing parts led to a fuel leak. These errors had huge complications only because the air traffic controls lead the plane 60 miles south to the actual way. The Portuguese investigation remains unpublished. Airbus blames the pilots to mishandle the plane. Captain Piche and Lagar get back to the cockpit again.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In August 2002, they received one of the highest honours of the airline pilots association to the longest glide ever in a passenger airliner (136 nm).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After the accident Airbus modified the checklist in the event of fuel imbalance. From now on the computer will check the fuel on board against the flight plan. Rolls Royce has been giving hydraulic pump assembly along with the engine and spares. Whatever the circumferences are, captain Piche saves the 306 peoples life.</p>
