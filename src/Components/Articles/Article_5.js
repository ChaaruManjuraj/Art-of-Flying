          The Last Hour of Flight 11
        </h3>

        <p>There are 3 planes crashed in this year in Indonesia. In 2015 Airasia flight 8501 was crashed in the sea in Indonesia. After that till this date the air crash investigation is going on there are some information in found after making the investigation on the founded few debris.</p>

        <p>And another military plane was crashed in the forest areas of Indonesia in 2015. The plane belongs to Indonesian air force. I don’t have any idea about the model of the plane and crash site.</p>
        <p>Now in 16-08-2015 an ATR 42 flight was crashed into a hill in Indonesia. I think we have to ban the ATR flights. Because the ATR flights have poor safety record. In the ATR flights the engines are very active means the engines is not so smooth. If we are piloting an ATR flights, we can absorb some type of vibrations during the running of the engines.</p>
        <p>My experience in piloting an ATR flight is more adventurous. I feel more conscious on the engine N1 and N2 switches. Because the ATR we cannot believe the ATR engines. The ATR engines are more power required engines and we cannot make the ATR engines to less fuel consumption.ATR engines are very rough. This is the story of ATR engines.</p>

        <p>Not only engines ATR flights has many absorbable drawbacks in their model. In the main pilot seat, the pilot cannot see the outside figure well. The wiper is not so well developed. Stick (steering) is so sensitive. That too sensitivity makes the plane uncontrollable. The flaps of the ATR flights is only 5. It is not enough to make the descend comfortable. If you apply the reverse thrust the plane is strongly vibrates. So we cannot make the ATR plane piloting as a smooth piloting.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>ATR flights are generally used to short haul flights. This type of twin engine turboprop engines are required to the aviation industry but not this type of defective planes. I really dislike the ATR flights. Not only ATR 42 I also dislike ATR 72 flight also. The autopilot of ATR flights are not satisfied for me.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In this case the air crash investigation is going on. We cannot determine any decision but I think this is a pilot error. because hitting a hill is too worst piloting. I don’t know weather this plane was in autopilot or manual mode and also I don’t know weather this plane was in cruising or takeoff run. So we cant determine this is a pilot error.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Any ways the flight is founded with 38 dead bodies. There is no necessity to tell you about the survivors. Thick fog and rain had hampered attempts by more than 250 rescuers and 11 aircraft to reach the wreckage on Monday, and they had been forced to turn back.</p>
        <p>The aviation sector in Indonesia is expanding fast but airlines are struggling to find enough well-trained personnel to keep up with the rapid growth in the archipelago of more than 17,000 islands.</p>
