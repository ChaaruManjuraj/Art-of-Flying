          The Last Hour of Flight 11
        </h3>

        <p>Three planes crashed in Indonesia this year. In 2015, AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed in the sea in Indonesia. Since then, the air crash investigation has been ongoing, and some information has been found after examining the few debris that were discovered.</p>

        <p>And another military plane crashed in the forested areas of Indonesia in 2015. The plane belonged to the Indonesian air force. I don't have any information about the model of the plane or the crash site.</p>
        <p>On 16-08-2015, an ATR 42 flight crashed into a hill in Indonesia. I think we should ban ATR flights due to their poor safety record. The engines of ATR flights are very active, meaning they are not smooth. While piloting an ATR flight, we can experience some vibrations from the engines.</p>
        <p>My experience of piloting an ATR flight was adventurous. I felt more conscious of the engine N1 and N2 switches. We cannot rely on the ATR engines as they are more power-hungry and we cannot reduce their fuel consumption. The ATR engines are rough. That is the story of ATR engines.</p>

          <img src="https://artofpiloting.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/150816101526-01-indonesia-missing-plane-0816-large-169.jpg" alt="ATR 72" style={{ width: "50%", height: "50%" }} />

        <p>Not only do ATR flights have many absorbable drawbacks in their design, but in the main pilot's seat, the pilot cannot see the outside well. The wiper is not well-developed, and the stick (steering) is too sensitive, which makes the plane uncontrollable. The flaps on ATR flights are only 5, which is not enough to make a comfortable descent. If you apply reverse thrust, the plane strongly vibrates, making ATR flight piloting far from smooth. </p>
        <p>ATR flights are generally used for short-haul flights, but this type of twin-engine turboprop engine is not required by the aviation industry. I really dislike ATR flights, not just the ATR 42, but also the ATR 72. The autopilot of ATR flights is not satisfactory for me. </p>
        <p>In this case, the air crash investigation is ongoing, and we cannot make any determinations, but I think this is a pilot error. Hitting a hill is a very poor demonstration of piloting. I don't know if the plane was in autopilot or manual mode, or if it was cruising or taking off, so we cannot determine if this is a pilot error. </p>
        <p>Anyway, the flight was found with 38 dead bodies. There is no need to mention the survivors. Thick fog and rain hampered attempts by more than 250 rescuers and 11 aircraft to reach the wreckage on Monday, forcing them to turn back. </p>
        <p>The aviation sector in Indonesia is expanding rapidly, but airlines are struggling to find enough well-trained personnel to keep up with the rapid growth across the archipelago of more than 17,000 islands. </p>
