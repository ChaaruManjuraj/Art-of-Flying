          What Happend to MH370?
        </h3>

        <p>Malaysian Airlines, one of the world's popular airliners, operates the routine Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The journey takes 6 hours.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Passengers are waiting for boarding at the gate of Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The 53-year-old pilot, Zahaire Ahmad Shah, is in command and is highly experienced with 18,365 hours of flight time. The first officer for the MH370 flight, Faraq, is less experienced. The flight is operated on a fully automated and computerized aircraft, the Boeing 777-200ER, which is the author's favorite aircraft. Faraq is flying the 777 for the first time without an instructor.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Once the passengers are on board, the pilot, Zahaire Ahmad Shah, and the co-pilot, Faraq, prepare the 777's flight management computer for the Beijing International Airport. The takeoff is routine without any complications. The air traffic control supervisor instructs the MH370 to turn towards its first waypoint, 'AGARI,' at 12:28 am. After 20 minutes in the air, the MH370 climbs to its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. On larger aircraft, the completion of the cruising checklist is the time when passengers can release their seatbelts and relax.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 1:02 am, the air traffic control supervisor in the Kuala Lumpur tower tried to contact the MH370, but received no response. Despite multiple attempts to reach the Triple Seven Malaysian, there was no answer. One of the world's most computerized and automatic aircraft, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, vanished without a trace.</p>

        <p>Three countries, China, America, Malaysia, and Australia, have joined forces to search for flight MH370. A multinational search effort was initiated in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the flight's signal was lost on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon expanded to include the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, collaborating with foreign aviation authorities and experts.</p>

        <p>The first suspect of investigators regarding the mystery flight is hijacking. In the past, a Ethiopian Airways Boeing 767 flight was hijacked, where the hijackers used a hair dryer machine as a weapon by transforming it with technology. They carried it on board, and a hijacker passenger entered the cockpit, demanding the pilot to fly to Australia. However, the pilot replied that they did not have enough fuel to fly to Australia, but the hijackers disagreed. After 3 hours of flying, the plane crashed near the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>According to Malaysian investigators, there were two passengers traveling suspiciously. In the case of hijacking, the pilot has many options to send an emergency message to the ground to indicate the hijacking. But the hijackers had a different plan; they entered the cockpit and changed the frequency of the transponder, making it impossible for the pilots to immediately contact the ground. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Captain Ahmad Shah was one of the most experienced pilots in Malaysian Airlines, having flown for 20 years. However, after an investigation into an Air France A330 crash in the Atlantic Ocean, it was revealed that the pilot had lost $100,000 in the stock market. Captain Ahmad Shah, however, was a sincere airline pilot and did not engage in such activities. There are many ways for a pilot to hijack their own plane. The whole cabin oxygen control is in the cockpit, and if the door is locked, no one can enter. After the co-pilot exits the cockpit, Shah could have carried out several hijacking activities. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Hijacking by hijackers or self-hijacking by the pilot are the most common possibilities for the disappearance of MH370. However, the author believes it was an alien attack. In both cases, debris should have been found, but no debris has been found to date, leading to the conclusion that it was a purely alien hijack.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The communication system of aircrafts should be improved, as sometimes air traffic control (ATC) instructs pilots to contact the center after 5 minutes due to limited radio connectivity in areas like the Oscan or mountains. The Gulf of Thailand also has limited radio connectivity, and the radio strength should be increased. Additionally, the radar strength in the aviation industry should be improved. The disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 is a wake-up call for the entire aviation industry to improve their safety measures. </p>
