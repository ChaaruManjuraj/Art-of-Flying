          What Happend to MH370?
        </h3>

        <p>Malaysian airlines – one of the popular airliners in the world. Malaysian airlines flight MH370 is a routine flight from Kuala lumpur to Beijing. The journey took 6 hours.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The passengers are waiting for the boarding in the Kuala Lumpur international airport at the gate. The 53 year old pilot Zahaire Ahmad Shah is in command. He is very experienced one. He has the experience of 18,365 hours. Faraq is the first officer for Malaysian airliner MH370 flight who is less experienced. The flight is one of the fully automated and computerised aircraft in the world Boeing 777-200ER. Personally this is my favourite aircraft. Faraq flying his 777 first time without an instructor.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The passengers are on board. In the cockpit the pilot Zahaire Ahmad Shah and the co-pilot Faraq preparing the 777 FMC (flight management computer) to the Beijing international airport. The takeoff is routine without any complication. In the air traffic control room the control supervisor instruct the MH370 turn into their first waypoint ‘AGARI’ at 12:28 am. After 20 minutes from takeoff the MH370 triple seven aircraft climbs into their cruising altitude 35000 feet. In bigger aircrafts the time which is complete the cruising checklist is the time for release the seatbelts and relax.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 01:02 am the air traffic control supervisor who is there in the control tower of Kuala lumpur tower tried to contact the MH370. But there is no answer. He tried again and again to contact the triple seven Malaysian but there is no answer. The one of the most computerised and automatic aircraft in the world Malaysian airlines flight MH370 vanished without a trace.</p>

        <p>There are three countries China, America, Malaysia and Australia are joined to search the flight MH370. A multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the flight’s signal was lost on secondary surveillance radar, and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to investigate the incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts.</p>

        <p>First suspect of the investigators to the mystery flight is hijack. Once the Ethiopian airliner Boeing 767 flight is hijacked. The hijackers used the hair drier machine as the weapon. That means they turn the hair drier machine into gun by technology and they carried that on board. The hijacker passenger enters into the cockpit and asks the pilot to fly to Australia. The pilot says “we don’t have the sufficient fuel to fly to Australia”. But the hijackers don’t agree with the pilot. The plane crashes after 3 hours of flying near the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>According to the Malaysian investigators there are two costumers travelling suspiciously. But if in the case of hijack, the pilot has many options to contact and send the emergency message to the ground ‘this is the hijacking call’. But the hijackers has one idea. When the hijackers enters to the cockpit they will turn the transponder switches to other frequency. So the pilots can’t contact the ground immediately.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Captain Ahmad Shah is one of the most experienced pilot in Malaysian airlines. He flew from 20 years in Malaysian airliners. One of the Air France A330 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. After the investigation we could know the pilot was loses 100,000 dollars in stock market. But Captain Ahmad Shah is one of the sincere airline pilot and he didn’t make any marketing. There are lot of ways to the pilot to hijack his own plane. The whole cabin oxygen control was in the cockpit. If he lock the cockpit door no one can enter into the cockpit. After the co-pilot coming out of the cockpit, Shah can perform several hijacking activity.</p>

        <p>Hijackers and pilot self hijack is most common possibilities for MH370. According to me it is an alien attack. Because in both the cases the debris should be found. But no debris are found till date. So it is a purely an alien hijack.</p>
        <p>Mainly the communication system of the aircraft should be repaired. Sometimes the ATC told to contact the centre after 5 minutes. This is because of the limited radio connectivity in the Oscan or in mountain areas etc. The Gulf of Thailand is one of the limited radio connectivity area. We have to increase the radio strength. We have to increase the radar strength in the aviation field. Malaysian airliners MH370 is a indication to the world about the luck poles of the entire aviation.</p>
