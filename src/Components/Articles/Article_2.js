          The Last Hour of Flight 11
        </h3>

        <p>On the evening of September 11th 2001, the FBI was called into Logan airport, Boston, USA to examine two check-in bags. The bags were missed their flight. Their flight was American Airlines Flight 11 which bounded for Los Angeles.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The owner of the luggage is Mohammed Atta – a ring leader of Al-Qaeda terrible event. Inside one of his bags, the FBI made an extraordinary discovery. Along with flight training videos, a small copy of Quran and a five page document handwritten in Arabic. It was a kind of hijack manual! It contained the justification to the hijack.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Few lines from the hijacker’s manual:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Purify your soul from all the unclear things. Completely forget something called this world. Afterwards begins the happy life.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Among the hijacking victims, on the bright morning of September 11th 2001, the passengers and crew of American Airlines flight 11 – first to the four planes crashed that day.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This article contains the last hour of the Flight 11 which is the first out of four planes to crash the World Trade Centre on September 11th 2001.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:46 AM – the passengers boarded the plane to 8:46 AM – the Boeing 767 hits the north tower of WTC in the New York.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:46 AM, September 11th 2001, with just few passengers yet to board, flight 11 is 13 minutes away for the take-off. Betty Ong was the one of the most experienced cabin crew. She was scheduled to work today. Amy Sweeny – young beautiful women is the other experienced flight attendant.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>First officer Thomas McGuinness was 42 years old; a married with two children. He was a former Airforce pilot. Captain John Ogonowskie was 52 years old, a married with three daughters. Captain Ogonowskie was a very experienced pilot with 23 years of experience with American Airliners and 7 years of experience in Airforce.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:47 AM, Boston airtraffic control centre was managing one of the busiest air traffic in the world. The weather and the clear visibility made their work little easy that day. In 12 minutes flight 11 would take-off from the Boston controlled airspace.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:48 AM, the last passenger on boarded the Flight 11. Among the passengers Italiar Lowin – a brilliant software designer is the one. He grew up in America and moved to Riyadh with his family when he was 14 years old. He had joined Al-Qaeda when he was 23. He seated directly in front of one of the hijackers Satam-al-Saqami. One of the last passengers to board AA Flight 11 is Mohammad Atta. Opposite to the Atta, Wail-al-Shehri had a clear view of cockpit door. Abdulaziz-al-Omari was another one terrorist who sat beside Wail-al-Shehri.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:54 AM, the American Airliners Flight 11 was cleared for push back. While flight 11 was waiting for the take-off clearance, Mohammad Atta made one last call. He called Malin-al-Shaheed – The terrorist leader on board of United Airliners Flight 93 which was taxiing a few hundred meters away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:59 AM, at the 09 runway of General Logan International airport, Boston, the Flight 11 Took-off.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As the Flight 11 climbed to its cruising altitude, preparations for the attack began. The weapons smuggled by the terrorists including knifes and some domestic tools known as box cutters was taken outside. Following the standard procedures, the flight attendants closed curtain between the three classes of cabin.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the terrorist had a device which looked like a bomb. That contained yellow and black coloured wire.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:08 AM, the AA Flight 11 was cleared to climb and maintain flight level 280. The pilots were still had to wear their seat belts.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:12 AM, the hijackers began their operations by shouting Allah-hu-Akbar. At the same time, in the airtraffic control room, the controllers advised Flight 11 to contact Boston Centre at 125.120.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:13 AM, American Airliners Flight 11 was turning 200 left. Three of the hijackers got rushed into the cockpit and put the pilots into the gunpoint and killed by knife instantly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Terrorist leader Mohammad Atta announced that the flight has been hijacked. Flight attendant Sweeny watched that one of the hijackers got a human bomb. One of the terrorist sprayed a kind of gas all over the passenger cabin. After that all five hijackers barricaded themselves into the cockpit. No one in the plane had seen or heard them again.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Passengers in the business class were first evacuated to the economy class by the flight attendants.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the ATC, the controllers instruct the Flight 11 heavy to climb FL 350. But there was no acknowledgement. Airtraffic controller got puzzled.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Flight 11 starts to drift silently off the course. Soon after Boston centre communication-1 radio lost control of Flight 11, its transponder was switched off. Flight 11 was no longer transmitting its data to the ATC. Only primary radar was showing its position. The plane was still appearing as inflight.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The autopilot master switch was now switched off by the terrorists and manually handled. They were well trained in the Flight Simulators.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:17 AM, still there was no answer from the Cactus 11 [ATC call name of American Airlines Flight 11]. The Flight attendants now organised themselves as teems to deal with the on board emergency. The flight attendants made repeated attempt to contact the cockpit. But all intercom attempts to the cockpit go unanswered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:19 AM, Betty Ong attempts to call the ground. She informed the American Airliner Maintenance company. But no one in the cabin knows what was happening in the deck. Sweeny made one more attempt to call the cockpit. But that went useless.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After 10 minutes of the hijack, the hijackers decided to talk to the passengers. But they pressed a wrong key. Their announcement was broadcasted to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:24 AM, they announced their message. That original call contains;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you’ll be OK. You are returning to the airport. Nobody move. Everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves, you’ll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now the airtraffic controllers in the Boston centre realized that the American Airliners Flight 11 had hijacked. Amy Sweeny called the ground and told that the American Airliner Maintenance Company about the hijackers’ seat number.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now United Airliners Flight 93 has airborne. The five hijackers in the UA 93 are yet to move.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Betty Ong and Amy Sweeny are now worked together giving more information to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:33 AM, the Flight 11 was drifting towards the North tower of WTC. The hijackers now performed the 1800 left turn. In fact the banking limit of a commercial jet is 300. Hijackers banked 767 until 500 at that moment. The plane was now heading south following the course of Hudson River which will direct the plane to the New York City.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:36 AM, they made another dangerous course change. At 8:37 the Boston airtraffic controls make a direct call to the US Airforce. They requested to follow AA 11 with F-19 fighters.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Twin Tower was now clearly in sight to the hijackers. The hijackers now executed terrifying manure – the steep dive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:41 AM, at the New York Airtraffic control, reported that the Flight 11 had just passed their controlled air space.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:43 AM, in Manhattan, the rush hour had reached its peak.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:46 AM, the American Airliners Flight 11 was heading south. The Aircraft’s airspeed increased dramatically due to the dive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Finally at 8:46:40 AM, the Flight 11 disappeared from the primary radar.</p>
