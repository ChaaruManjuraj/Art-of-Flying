          The Last Hour of Flight 11
        </h3>
        <p>On the evening of September 11th, 2001, the FBI was called to Logan airport in Boston, USA to examine two missing check-in bags. Their owner was Mohammed Atta, a ringleader of the Al-Qaeda attack. Inside one of the bags, the FBI made a remarkable discovery. Along with flight training videos, there was a small copy of the Quran and a five-page document handwritten in Arabic that served as a hijacking manual. It contained the justification for the hijacking.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Here are a few lines from the hijacker's manual:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Purify your soul from all unclear things. Completely forget about the world. Afterwards, the happy life begins."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Among the victims of the hijacking on the morning of September 11th, 2001, were the passengers and crew of American Airlines Flight 11, the first of the four planes to crash that day.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This article details the last hour of Flight 11, which was the first of the four planes to crash into the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:46 AM, the passengers boarded the plane, and at 8:46 AM, the Boeing 767 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:46 AM on September 11th, 2001, with only a few passengers still to board, Flight 11 was 13 minutes away from takeoff. One of the experienced cabin crew members was Betty Ong, who was scheduled to work that day. The other experienced flight attendant was Amy Sweeney, a young and beautiful woman.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>First Officer Thomas McGuinness was 42 years old, married with two children, and a former Airforce pilot. Captain John Ogonowski was 52 years old, married with three daughters, and a very experienced pilot with 23 years of experience with American Airlines and 7 years of experience in the Airforce.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:47 AM, the Boston air traffic control center was managing one of the busiest air traffic operations in the world. The clear weather and visibility made their work easier that day. In 12 minutes, Flight 11 would take off from the Boston controlled airspace.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:48 AM, the last passenger boarded Flight 11. Among them was Italiar Lowin, a brilliant software designer. He grew up in America but moved to Riyadh with his family when he was 14 years old. He joined Al-Qaeda at 23 years of age and was seated directly in front of hijacker Satam-al-Saqami. The last passenger to board AA Flight 11 was Mohammad Atta. Wail-al-Shehri had a clear view of the cockpit door from his seat opposite Atta, and Abdulaziz-al-Omari was another terrorist who sat beside Wail-al-Shehri.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:54 AM, American Airlines Flight 11 was cleared for pushback. While waiting for takeoff clearance, Mohammad Atta made one final call to Malin-al-Shaheed, the terrorist leader on board United Airlines Flight 93, which was taxiing a few hundred meters away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:54 AM, the American Airliners Flight 11 was cleared for push back. While flight 11 was waiting for the take-off clearance, Mohammad Atta made one last call. He called Malin-al-Shaheed – The terrorist leader on board of United Airliners Flight 93 which was taxiing a few hundred meters away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 7:59 AM, on the 09 runway of General Logan International Airport in Boston, Flight 11 took off.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As Flight 11 climbed to its cruising altitude, the preparations for the attack began. The terrorists smuggled weapons, including knives and domestic tools known as box cutters, and took them out. Following standard procedures, the flight attendants closed the curtain between the three classes of the cabin.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the terrorists had a device that looked like a bomb and contained yellow and black colored wires.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:08 AM, AA Flight 11 was cleared to climb and maintain flight level 280. The pilots still had to wear their seat belts.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:12 AM, the hijackers began their operation by shouting "Allah-hu-Akbar". At the same time, the air traffic control room advised Flight 11 to contact Boston Centre at 125.120.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:13 AM, American Airlines Flight 11 was turning 200 degrees left. Three hijackers rushed into the cockpit and put the pilots at gunpoint and killed them instantly with knives.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Terrorist leader Mohammad Atta announced that the flight had been hijacked. Flight attendant Sweeny saw that one of the hijackers had a human bomb. One of the terrorists sprayed a gas all over the passenger cabin, and then all five hijackers barricaded themselves in the cockpit. No one on the plane saw or heard from them again.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The flight attendants first evacuated the passengers in the business class to the economy class.</p>

        <p>Terrorist leader Mohammad Atta announced that the flight had been hijacked. Flight attendant Sweeney watched as one of the hijackers got a human bomb. One of the terrorists sprayed a gas throughout the passenger cabin. After that, all five hijackers barricaded themselves into the cockpit and were not seen or heard from again. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Passengers in the business class were first evacuated to the economy class by the flight attendants. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the ATC, the controllers instructed Flight 11 heavy to climb to FL 350, but there was no acknowledgment. The air traffic controller was puzzled. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Flight 11 began to drift off course. Soon after, Boston Centre communication-1 radio lost control of Flight 11, as its transponder was switched off. The flight was no longer transmitting data to the ATC and was only being tracked by primary radar, which still showed it as inflight. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The terrorists switched off the autopilot master switch and manually controlled the plane, as they were well-trained in flight simulators. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:17 AM, there was still no answer from Cactus 11 (the ATC call name of American Airlines Flight 11). The flight attendants organized themselves into teams to handle the on-board emergency. They made repeated attempts to contact the cockpit, but all intercom attempts went unanswered. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:19 AM, Betty Ong attempted to call the ground and informed the American Airlines Maintenance Company. However, no one in the cabin knew what was happening on the deck. Sweeney made another attempt to call the cockpit, but it was unsuccessful. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After 10 minutes of the hijacking, the hijackers decided to talk to the passengers, but they pressed the wrong key and their announcement was broadcast to the ground. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:24 AM, they made their announcement, which contained:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you’ll be OK. You’re returning to the airport. Nobody move. Everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves, you’ll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now the air traffic controllers at the Boston center realized that American Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked. Amy Sweeney called the ground and informed the American Airlines Maintenance Company about the hijackers' seat numbers.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>United Airlines Flight 93 was now airborne, but the five hijackers on board UA 93 had not yet made a move.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Betty Ong and Amy Sweeney were now working together, providing more information to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:33 AM, Flight 11 was drifting towards the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The hijackers made a 1,800 degree left turn, which was a dangerous maneuver as the banking limit of a commercial jet is 300. At that moment, the hijackers banked the 767 to 500 degrees. The plane was now heading south, following the course of the Hudson River, which would direct it to New York City.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:36 AM, they made another dangerous course change. At 8:37, the Boston air traffic controllers made a direct call to the US Air Force, requesting that they follow AA 11 with F-19 fighters.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Twin Towers were now clearly in sight for the hijackers. The hijackers executed a terrifying maneuver: a steep dive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:41 AM, the New York air traffic control reported that Flight 11 had just passed their controlled air space.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:43 AM, in Manhattan, rush hour had reached its peak.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 8:46 AM, American Airlines Flight 11 was heading south and its airspeed increased dramatically due to the dive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Finally, at 8:46:40 AM, Flight 11 disappeared from primary radar.</p>
