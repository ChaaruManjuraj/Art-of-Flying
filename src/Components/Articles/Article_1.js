        </h3>

        <p>Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 prepares to land at Schiphol International airport, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The crew continues to fly ‘The State of the Art’ Boeing 737. During the final movements of the flight, the landing turns into a catastrophe leaving behind the plane falling down like a chunk of rock.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 involved the most popular plane on earth onto which Nearly 1.5 million passengers board world every day. The Investigators had to figure out if the problem was with the plane or with the crew which was flying it quickly and also to discover the source of error.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On the morning of February 25th 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 happened to become the first plane to crash at Amsterdam Schiphol airport in more than ten years.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the eye witnesses said, “It smashed into the ground really hard. It made a tremendous noise.” The plane had hit the ground in the muddy field, just north of the runway 18R. Since the crash was very close to the airport, the rescue workers had managed to arrive quickly. Most of the passengers had survived and many were badly injured. The Survivors were then shifted to the local hospital. Images of the Amsterdam accident, the third crash of a passenger jet in the past six weeks, had quickly spread around the world.</p>

        <p>It did not take too long for the Dutch safety board to arrive at the spot to carry forward the investigation. They were in fact not alone as the crash had involved an America-made plane. The US national transportation safety board had sent its expert air crash investigator Joseph Sedor to Amsterdam.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Flight 1951 is one of the most advanced aircrafts in the sky among the Boeing 737-800 series. It is designed to travel medium to longer routes at higher altitudes. The FMR Boeing vice president Gordon Bethune said “The new generation 737-800 is still the best series of Boeing planes ever built. We developed this airplane that had improved avionics, improved cockpit and simpler systems that required less patience.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators knew that it was not just like any other plane since The 737 is the world’s best-selling commercial jet. More than 5000 Boeing 737 are seen flying each day, carrying about 1.5 million passengers in a day. Investigators had to quickly determine the reason behind this crash bearing in mind the above fact.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>What they had known so far was that Flight 1951 had been travelling from Istanbul, Turkey to Amsterdam with 158 passengers on board in the early morning including four engineers from Boeing. The crash had killed 9 people including three of the engineers and the pilots in the cockpit.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>British Airways Flight 38 plane had crashed recently in a way similar to this accident. The 777 had crashed short of the runway. The British Airways pilots had indeed reported that both the engines had flamed out just before landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the time of the Turkish Airlines crash, the cause of the accident was not found out in spite of the availability of plenty of clues left for the investigators. The plane and its engines were in a good condition to analyse. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were also found to be in good condition. There were a plenty of survivors who were at the tips of their toes to describe what had happened.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>According to the passengers, the landing had been as per routine. Suddenly, the plane had simply dropped out from the sky and had hit the ground. But the biggest clue was found in the site of the crash itself. The wreckages had not spread out and thus revealed to the investigators that the plane was not travelling forwarded at high speed when it hit the ground. The passenger report and the wreckage condition made the investigators suspect the engines immediately.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was no evidence of fire on the fuel gauge. In many crashes fuel in the plane’s tanks are often the major reasons behind the crash. In this case, lack of fire had raised a question. Had the engine stopped running because Flight 1951 had simply run out of fuel? But the location and the condition of the plane’s engines had suggested that the reason behind the crash was not the fuel.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Joseph Sedor said “She looks like she was running at that moment. When we first looked at it, the engines had ended up in a good condition. The initial impression was that they probably produced thrust during the impact.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Only the flight data recorder would tell the investigators how much power the engines were generating in the plane seconds before the crash. It would not take long to discover that there was plenty of fuel in the tanks of Flight 1951 and thus Flight 1951 had definitely not run out of fuel.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Passengers reported in the final moments before the crash that the plane had hit what felt like turbulence. It had pointed out to the investigators a well-known culprit – the ‘microburst’. A microburst is a powerful phenomenon where there occurs a shoot by the storm clouds. It can literally spam the planes which fly low to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 1985, a Delta Airlines flight was caught by the microburst while landing in Dallas Ft. Worth International airport. The plane had hit the ground on short of the runway. 137 people were killed in the incident.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators knew that there were no heavy clouds above the airport at the time of the accident. A powerful gust wind might have been the cause. The flight data recorder had recorded the wind speed outside the plane. Investigators were to analyse the flight data to discover the microburst theory.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In the meantime the rescue-crew had made an unusually surprising discovery. There were three pilots in the cockpit! Why was there a third man in the cockpit? Since none of the three pilots had survived, it was crucial for the investigators to analyse the cockpit voice recorder. It had recorded the conversation in the cockpit. The condition of the recorder was excellent. The voice of the third pilot was thus uncovered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For the first officer Murat Sezer, this was the training flight as He was new to the airline. He was showing the intercession landing in the Amsterdam. Captain Hasan Tahsin Arısan was on double duty. He was training his first officer and was in command of Flight 1951. There was a third pilot in the cockpit, the safety pilot. He was there to keep his eyes on the flight progress during this training mission.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The voice recorder revealed that the three crew members began preparing for the landing while still above 8500 feet. But the voice recorder included an unusual sound – the landing gear configuration warning. The engineer from Boeing confirmed that the warning was due to the landing gear configuration. The alarm kept on buzzing. Captain Arısan continuously dismissed it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The warning was the solid clue. But the investigators could not see how the landing gear configuration horn had led to a crash. The crew of Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 got a warning to extend their landing gear when they were thousands of feet high up in the air.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Investigators had then turned to the flight data recorder to solve some unusual aspects. The analysis of wind speed outside the aircraft was completed and was clear. But the flight data recorder provided some valuable information to solve some of the mystery surrounding the crash. It also included the cause of the landing gear warning.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the instruments called radio altimeter that measures the altitude was showing that the plane was already on the ground. The Boeing 737 is equipped with two separate altimeters. One measures the air pressure to determine the plane’s height above sea level and that reading is displayed permanently on the cockpit at both the pilot’s flight display. The plane is also equipped with radio altimeter which is made up of four antennas. Two to transmit signals to the ground and two others read the signal which bounces back to determine the plane’s height. One antenna feeds the reading to the first officer’s display while another one feeds the captain’s display. In the case of Flight 1951, the captain side was wrong, most of the flight.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators went back to the CVR and made a puzzling discovery. Captain Arısan seemed to know that the landing gear warning was caused by the faulty radio altimeter. Throughout most of the approach, the captain’s radio altimeter had been displaying a reading of -8 feet. This made the warning to extend the gear.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators learnt that the Flight 1951 was still about 17 kilometres from the airport. Controllers suggested the pilots to carry out final turn to line up with the runway. This turn put Flight 1951 in line with runway 18R. It was equipped with the instrument landing system (ILS) which sensed the signal outlining the ideal descend path to the foot of the runway. The autopilot followed the glide path while the flight was few hundred feet above the ground. Then the pilots took over. It made the landing almost effortless.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew began its configuration for landing neglecting the warning caused by the false reading of the radio altimeter. 10 kilometres out Flight 1951 caught the ILS signal. The safety pilot Olcay Özgür then reminded captain Arısan about the failed altimeter. Investigators were stumped. The crew knew about the malfunction and continued their approach.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The whole premise of airline safety is based on the idea that they may face any number of failures and should still be able to arrive safely. The radio altimeter is just an instrument. How can its failure be responsible for the plane crash?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators suspected that the pilots had no proper guidance to their approach. They carefully reviewed every instruction. By following the controller’s instructions the crew made their final turn much too close to the runway. International guidelines call for approaching planes to intercept the signal that guided them to the runway from below.  So the pilots did not have to make any drastic last minute course corrections to get to it. But Flight 1951 was given instructions that brought it to the threshold to the glideslope while still above it. It is a common practice at Schiphol. It gets the planes to the runway faster.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Approaching the glideslope from above the path was more difficult mostly because the crew had to suddenly slow the plane down and descend rapidly to intercept the ILS signal. This is also called as ‘slam dunk’ approach. The approach from above the path would increase the workload for the crew. But it was again a standard practice at Schiphol airport.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Their real trouble started when they were 400 feet above the ground, the stall warning. Arisan was forced to safeguard his plane but just 400 feet above the ground and only 1.5 kilometres from the runway the Boeing 737 suddenly fell down from the sky. It only took a few seconds to hit the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew was configuring its plane for landing which was about to be completed. Most airlines have regulations that call for flight has to be stabilized to have all checklists completed by the time it hits one thousand feet. In fact this crew still was running its checklist till the moment of crisis – 460 feet above the ground. Because of the instability, the flight crew was in the very high workload environment in the last thousand feet of the flight.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The radio altimeter was malfunctioning. The aircraft was giving a lot of warnings. The crew was assigned a challenging approach and they were executing the checklist late. But none of these reasons could explain why Flight 1951 had crashed. But the flight data recorder provided another clue. Moments before Flight 1951 hit the ground, the plane’s engines were idle! Now this accident connected to the Heathrow incident.</p>
        <p></p> 
        <p>The throttle was idle until the final twenty seconds of the flight. But then they spotted something which was very different from the accident at Heathrow. For some reason, when still thousands of feet above the ground, the plane’s computer had begun preparing to touchdown. In retard fly mode, the engine power would reduce to idle by the flight computers and the plane’s nose automatically pitches up to the touch down position. The Plane should only be in this configuration just before the touch down. But Flight 1951 went into a slow nose up position well before touchdown causing the plane to fly slower and slower throughout its descend.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Why was Flight 1951 in its landing mode? Why could not any of the three pilots notice that they were flying slowly? The trouble seemed to start from the malfunctioning altimeter. The computer that flew the plane consisted of two main systems that were the autopilot and the auto throttle. The two systems work dependently on each other. Only one of the radio altimeters provided the information to the auto throttle. The investigators started to sync the faulty radio altimeter and idle power.</p>

          <figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Capt. Hasan Tahsin Arisan</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The only altimeter feeding information to the auto throttle was the captain’s and it was wrong. It showed -8 feet most of the Flight 1951’s approach. Investigators needed to know what went wrong with the radio altimeter. It was beginning to look as though the faulty radio altimeter triggered the events that led to the crash. Investigators also needed to know what had gone wrong with it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On a 737, the transmitting and receiving antenna for both radio altimeters are lined up under the cockpit. Three of the antennas were destroyed in the crash. They could not be tested. But one antenna from the captain’s side was not damaged. Investigators considered two possibilities, the failure of one of the components or some sort of interference that had caused the faulty reading. The only component that survived in the crash was checked out. The computers that controlled the system also seemed to be working. But investigators made a curious discovery, the radio altimeters were not at all installed in the Flight 1951 when it was delivered to Turkish Airlines. This changed the entire focus of the investigation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When the plane’s maintenance log was studied, investigators found that the radio altimeter on the plane had a problematic history. The document showed that a little more than a year before the crash, both the computers were replaced because of the complaints that they were showing faulty readings. One of the incidences involved a radio altimeter reading of -8 feet. Mechanics had repeatedly swapped the computer and replaced the antennas to try to solve the problem. It showed that the Turkish Airlines tried several ways to fix the problem but could not yet fix it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the time of the accident, Turkish Airlines had a fleet of 52 Boeing 737-800s. Investigators discovered that in the year before the crash Turkish Airline had reported 235 problems with the radio altimeters in their 737-800 series planes. If the problem was so wide spread, investigators wondered why it had not caused any other serious problem before that accident. They did not have to dig more to find out the impact.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On the same plane, twice in the 48 hours, the radio altimeter had showed negative readings putting the plane into retard fly mode. Both the times the crew had noticed the problem. Disengaging the auto throttle in both the planes had led to safe landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Months after the crash, other operators came up with similar stories. In Australia, Netherlands, Canada, Austria pilots reported their 737s going into retard fly mode when the left radio altimeter showed a faulty reading. Each of those crew reacted the same way. They had to disengage the auto throttle and push the power back-up manually. They all had landed safely.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2008, Boeing received a shocking number of 2569 reports about the faulty radio altimeters on their latest 737s. Very few of the cases involved the plane going into the retard fly mode. Boeing also tried but could not find the cause of the failures. They concluded that the radio altimeter problem was not a thread to safety because the 737 gave enough number of warnings So that crew could interfere and land safely. In fact, in every incident, the crew was able to recover. Turkish Airliner Flight was always an exception and the Investigators would not know why.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Finally, as investigators again revisited the final movements of Flight 1951, the circumstances of the tragedy became clear. They saw a remarkable sequence of events which brought down this plane. They discovered that the plane went into landing mode and pulled back the power at the worst possible movement, exactly when the crew was descending to meet the glideslope. As the crew was configuring its plane to meet the glideslope descend, it expected that the plane would slow down as a part of that manure. But the plane was actually slowing down because the computer was in landing mode. That is exactly why none of the three pilots had anything to say about the throttle moving to idle.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 2000 feet, with the glideslope below them, the pilots had to reduce the speed while descending steeply. They believed that the throttle was moving back for descending into the glideslope. In fact the auto throttle was slowing the plane down because it had got into the landing mode. It would continue to slow the plane down until it stalled. In a hurry to complete their checklists none of the pilots noticed the warning that their speed was dropping dangerously. At First the red bar had appeared on their primary flight display followed by the dropping of the airspeed and the appearance of the flashing light on their speed box which was meant get the attention of the pilots. At this point either no one had seen the alert. By the time the captain had pulled the thrust back, it was unrecoverable and it was too late to save the plane.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Boeing did not know the potentially deadly effect of a faulty radio altimeter. But on the February 25th 2009, it trigged an unusual sequence of events that bought down a jetliner and killed 9 people.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators determined that Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crashed mainly because the pilots did not recognise the consequences of the warnings they were getting. This was not the first plane to crash because the crew did not understand what the plane was telling. In 1996, the plane Aeroperu 757 crashed when the pilots could not receive the warning about their altitude and airspeed. The plane flew into the Pacific Ocean. 61 passengers and 9 of the crew were killed. In 1995, the flight management system on a Boeing 767 was malfunctioning. The last minute change of the flight plan puzzled the program. They mistook and entered a course that took them to a 9000 feet mountain. 159 people died in that crash.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>NASA has been working on what is called the “Integrated intelligent flight deck”, a project that helps humans to use the technology that surrounds them in the cockpit. What some researches are finding in this technology are those that should not replace the gauges but should work with them.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Boeing and Airbus are the two largest aircraft manufacturers of passenger jets and take very different approaches to the relationship between humans and technology. Airbus gives the flight computer much of the decision-making power in the cockpit. But Boeing has a different view. Its philosophy is to provide enough information to pilots and have them make decisions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The final report for the Turkish Airlines tragedy blames the failure of technology. The cause of the failure of the radio altimeter was never uncovered. The Dutch investigation has asked Boeing to improve the reliability of the system. The Report also blames the crew for not having noticed that their speed was dropping dangerously. Finally the Turkish Airlines Flight 1951’s accident raises a question stating, “”Is a plane becoming too complex?”.</p>
