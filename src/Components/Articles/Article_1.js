          Who's on Control?
        </h3>

        <p>Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 was preparing to land at Schiphol International Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The crew was operating the state-of-the-art Boeing 737, but during the final stages of the flight, a catastrophic landing occurred, causing the plane to crash like a rock. </p>
        <p>The crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 involved one of the world's most popular aircrafts, with nearly 1.5 million passengers boarding it every day. The investigation aimed to quickly determine if the problem was with the plane or the crew, and to uncover the source of the error. </p>
        <p>On the morning of February 25th, 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 became the first plane to crash at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in over ten years. </p>
        <p>An eyewitness reported, "It hit the ground very hard, making a tremendous noise." The plane impacted a muddy field just north of runway 18R. Due to the close proximity to the airport, rescue workers were able to arrive promptly. Many passengers survived, but some were badly injured and required transportation to a local hospital. News of the Amsterdam crash, the third passenger jet crash in the past six weeks, quickly spread across the world. </p>

        <p>It did not take too long for the Dutch safety board to arrive at the spot to carry forward the investigation. They were in fact not alone as the crash had involved an America-made plane. The US national transportation safety board had sent its expert air crash investigator Joseph Sedor to Amsterdam.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Flight 1951 is one of the most advanced aircrafts in the sky among the Boeing 737-800 series. It is designed to travel medium to longer routes at higher altitudes. The FMR Boeing vice president Gordon Bethune said “The new generation 737-800 is still the best series of Boeing planes ever built. We developed this airplane that had improved avionics, improved cockpit and simpler systems that required less patience.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators knew that it was not just like any other plane since The 737 is the world’s best-selling commercial jet. More than 5000 Boeing 737 are seen flying each day, carrying about 1.5 million passengers in a day. Investigators had to quickly determine the reason behind this crash bearing in mind the above fact.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>What they had known so far was that Flight 1951 had been travelling from Istanbul, Turkey to Amsterdam with 158 passengers on board in the early morning including four engineers from Boeing. The crash had killed 9 people including three of the engineers and the pilots in the cockpit.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>British Airways Flight 38 plane had crashed recently in a way similar to this accident. The 777 had crashed short of the runway. The British Airways pilots had indeed reported that both the engines had flamed out just before landing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the time of the Turkish Airlines crash, the cause of the accident was not found out in spite of the availability of plenty of clues left for the investigators. The plane and its engines were in a good condition to analyse. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were also found to be in good condition. There were a plenty of survivors who were at the tips of their toes to describe what had happened.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>According to the passengers, the landing had been as per routine. Suddenly, the plane had simply dropped out from the sky and had hit the ground. But the biggest clue was found in the site of the crash itself. The wreckages had not spread out and thus revealed to the investigators that the plane was not travelling forwarded at high speed when it hit the ground. The passenger report and the wreckage condition made the investigators suspect the engines immediately.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There was no evidence of fire on the fuel gauge. In many crashes fuel in the plane’s tanks are often the major reasons behind the crash. In this case, lack of fire had raised a question. Had the engine stopped running because Flight 1951 had simply run out of fuel? But the location and the condition of the plane’s engines had suggested that the reason behind the crash was not the fuel.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Joseph Sedor said “She looks like she was running at that moment. When we first looked at it, the engines had ended up in a good condition. The initial impression was that they probably produced thrust during the impact.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Only the flight data recorder would tell the investigators how much power the engines were generating in the plane seconds before the crash. It would not take long to discover that there was plenty of fuel in the tanks of Flight 1951 and thus Flight 1951 had definitely not run out of fuel.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Passengers reported in the final moments before the crash that the plane had hit what felt like turbulence. It had pointed out to the investigators a well-known culprit – the ‘microburst’. A microburst is a powerful phenomenon where there occurs a shoot by the storm clouds. It can literally spam the planes which fly low to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 1985, a Delta Airlines flight was caught by the microburst while landing in Dallas Ft. Worth International airport. The plane had hit the ground on short of the runway. 137 people were killed in the incident.</p>
        <p>Investigators knew that there were no heavy clouds above the airport at the time of the accident, and a powerful gust of wind might have been the cause. The flight data recorder recorded the wind speed outside the plane, and investigators were set to analyze the flight data to discover the microburst theory.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In the meantime, the rescue crew had made an unusually surprising discovery: there were three pilots in the cockpit! Why was there a third man in the cockpit? Since none of the three pilots had survived, it was crucial for the investigators to analyze the cockpit voice recorder, which had recorded the conversation in the cockpit. The condition of the recorder was excellent, so the voice of the third pilot was uncovered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For the first officer, Murat Sezer, this was a training flight. He was new to the airline and was demonstrating the intercession landing in Amsterdam. Captain Hasan Tahsin Arısan was on double duty, training his first officer and commanding Flight 1951. The third pilot in the cockpit was a safety pilot, there to keep an eye on the flight progress during the training mission.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The voice recorder revealed that the three crew members began preparing for the landing while they were still above 8,500 feet. However, the voice recorder included an unusual sound: the landing gear configuration warning. The engineer from Boeing confirmed that the warning was due to the landing gear configuration, and the alarm kept buzzing. Captain Arısan continuously dismissed it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The warning was a solid clue, but investigators couldn't see how the landing gear configuration horn led to a crash. The crew of Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 received a warning to extend their landing gear when they were thousands of feet high in the air.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The investigators then turned to the flight data recorder to solve some unusual aspects. The analysis of wind speed outside the aircraft was completed and clear, but the flight data recorder provided some valuable information to solve some of the mystery surrounding the crash, including the cause of the landing gear warning.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the instruments, a radio altimeter that measures altitude, was showing that the plane was already on the ground. The Boeing 737 is equipped with two separate altimeters. One measures air pressure to determine the plane's height above sea level and displays the reading permanently on the cockpit at both the pilot's flight display. The plane is also equipped with a radio altimeter, which consists of four antennas: two to transmit signals to the ground and two to read the signal that bounces back to determine the plane's height. One antenna feeds the reading to the first officer's display, while another feeds the captain's display. In the case of Flight 1951, the captain's side was wrong for most of the flight.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators went back to the CVR and made a puzzling discovery: Captain Arısan seemed to know that the landing gear warning was caused by the faulty radio altimeter. Throughout most of the approach, the captain's radio altimeter had been displaying a reading of -8 feet, which triggered the warning to extend the gear.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators learned that Flight 1951 was still about 17 kilometers from the airport. Controllers suggested the pilots to carry out a final turn to line up with the runway, putting the flight in line with runway 18R. It was equipped with the Instrument Landing System (ILS), which sensed the signal outlining the ideal descent path to the foot of the runway. The autopilot followed the glide path while the flight was a few hundred feet above the ground, and then the pilots took over, making the landing almost effortless.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew began configuring for landing, neglecting the warning caused by the false reading of the radio altimeter. 10 kilometers out, Flight 1951 caught the ILS signal. The safety pilot, Olcay Özgür, then reminded Captain Arısan about the failed altimeter. Investigators were stumped, as the crew knew about the malfunction and continued their approach.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The whole premise of airline safety is based on the idea that, despite any number of failures, the plane should still be able to arrive safely. The radio altimeter is just an instrument, and its failure shouldn't be responsible for the plane crash.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators suspected that the pilots didn't have proper guidance for their approach, so they carefully reviewed every instruction. By following the controller's instructions, the crew made their final turn much too close to the runway. International guidelines call for approaching planes to intercept the signal that guides them to the runway from below, avoiding drastic last-minute course corrections. But Flight 1951 was given instructions that brought it to the threshold of the glide slope while still above it. This was a common practice at Schiphol and gets planes to the runway faster.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Approaching the glide slope from above the path was more difficult, as the crew had to suddenly slow the plane down and descend rapidly to intercept the ILS signal, also known as a "slam dunk" approach. This increased the workload for the crew, but it was again a standard practice at Schiphol airport.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Their real trouble started when, 400 feet above the ground, they received a stall warning. Captain Arisan was forced to safeguard the plane, but just 400 feet above the ground and only 1.5 kilometers from the runway, the Boeing 737 suddenly fell from the sky and hit the ground in just a few seconds.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The crew was configuring the plane for landing, which was about to be completed. Most airlines have regulations that call for the flight to be stabilized and for all checklists to be completed by the time it reaches one thousand feet. In fact, this crew was still running its checklist until the moment of crisis, 460 feet above the ground. Because of the instability, the flight crew was in a very high-workload environment in the last thousand feet of the flight.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The radio altimeter was malfunctioning, the aircraft was giving many warnings, the crew was assigned a challenging approach and was executing the checklist late, but none of these reasons could explain why Flight 1951 crashed. But the flight data recorder provided another clue: moments before Flight 1951 hit the ground, the plane's engines were idle! This connected the accident to the Heathrow incident.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The throttle was idle until the final twenty seconds of the flight, but then they spotted something that was very different from the accident at Heathrow. For some reason, when still thousands of feet above the ground, the plane's computer had begun preparing to touch down. In "retard fly" mode, the engine power would reduce to idle by the flight computer, and the plane's nose would automatically pitch up to the touchdown position. The plane should only be in this configuration just before the touchdown, but Flight 1951 went into a slow nose-up position well before touchdown, causing the plane to fly slower and slower throughout its descent.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Why was Flight 1951 in its landing mode? Why couldn't any of the three pilots notice that they were flying slowly? The trouble seemed to start with the malfunctioning altimeter. The computer that flew the plane consisted of two main systems: the autopilot and the auto throttle. The two systems work dependent on each other, and only one of the radio altimeters provided information to the auto throttle. The investigators started to sync the faulty radio altimeter and idle power. </p>

          <figcaption style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Capt. Hasan Tahsin Arisan</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The only altimeter feeding information to the auto throttle was the captain's, and it was incorrect. It showed -8 feet for most of Flight 1951's approach. Investigators needed to determine what went wrong with the radio altimeter, as it appeared that its failure may have triggered the events leading to the crash. They also needed to understand what caused the issue.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On a 737, the transmitting and receiving antennas for both radio altimeters are located under the cockpit. Three of these antennas were destroyed in the crash and could not be tested, but one antenna from the captain's side remained undamaged. Investigators considered two possibilities: the failure of one component or some sort of interference causing the incorrect reading. The only surviving component was thoroughly examined, and the computers controlling the system appeared to be functioning. However, investigators made a surprising discovery: the radio altimeters were never installed in Flight 1951 when it was delivered to Turkish Airlines. This completely altered the focus of the investigation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After reviewing the plane's maintenance log, investigators found that the radio altimeter had a problematic history. The log showed that a little over a year prior to the crash, both computers were replaced due to faulty readings. Mechanics had repeatedly swapped out the computer and replaced the antennas to try and solve the issue, but to no avail. The log indicated that Turkish Airlines had tried various solutions, but still could not fix the problem.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the time of the accident, Turkish Airlines operated a fleet of 52 Boeing 737-800s. Investigators discovered that in the year before the crash, Turkish Airlines reported 235 issues with the radio altimeters in their 737-800 series planes. If the problem was so widespread, investigators wondered why it hadn't caused any other serious issues before this accident. They didn't have to search much further to find out the impact.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Twice in the 48 hours prior to the crash, the radio altimeter on the same plane had shown negative readings, putting the plane into retard fly mode. Both times, the crew noticed the issue and safely landed by disengaging the auto throttle.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Months after the crash, other operators reported similar incidents. Pilots in Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, and Austria reported their 737s going into retard fly mode due to faulty readings from the left radio altimeter. Each crew reacted in the same way, disengaging the auto throttle and manually pushing the power back up. All landed safely.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2008, Boeing received an alarming 2569 reports of faulty radio altimeters on their latest 737s. Although few cases involved the plane going into retard fly mode, Boeing was unable to determine the cause of the failures. They concluded that the radio altimeter problem wasn't a threat to safety, as the 737 provided enough warnings for the crew to intervene and land safely. In fact, the crew was able to recover in every incident, except for Turkish Airlines Flight 1951. The cause of this exception remains unknown to investigators.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Finally, as investigators revisited the final movements of Flight 1951, the circumstances of the tragedy became clear. They saw a remarkable sequence of events that brought down the plane. They discovered that the plane went into landing mode and pulled back power at the worst possible moment, exactly when the crew was descending to meet the glide slope. As the crew was configuring the plane to meet the glide slope descent, it expected that the plane would slow down as part of that maneuver. But the plane was actually slowing down because the computer was in landing mode, which is why none of the three pilots had anything to say about the throttle moving to idle.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 2000 feet, with the glide slope below them, the pilots had to reduce speed while descending steeply. They believed that the throttle was moving back for descending into the glide slope. In fact, the auto throttle was slowing the plane down because it had entered landing mode. It would continue to slow the plane down until it stalled. In their hurry to complete their checklists, none of the pilots noticed the warning that their speed was dropping dangerously. At first, the red bar appeared on their primary flight display, followed by the dropping airspeed and the appearance of a flashing light on their speed box, which was meant to get the attention of the pilots. At this point, no one had seen the alert. By the time the captain had pulled the thrust back, it was unrecoverable, and it was too late to save the plane.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Boeing did not know the potentially deadly effect of a faulty radio altimeter. But on February 25th, 2009, it triggered an unusual sequence of events that brought down a jetliner and killed 9 people.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Investigators determined that Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crashed mainly because the pilots did not recognize the consequences of the warnings they were getting. This was not the first plane to crash because the crew did not understand what the plane was telling them. In 1996, the Aeroperu 757 crashed when the pilots could not receive the warning about their altitude and airspeed, causing the plane to fly into the Pacific Ocean. 61 passengers and 9 of the crew were killed. In 1995, the flight management system on a Boeing 767 was malfunctioning, and the last-minute change of the flight plan puzzled the program. They mistook and entered a course that took them to a 9000-foot mountain, resulting in the deaths of 159 people.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>NASA has been working on what is called the "Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck," a project that helps humans use the technology that surrounds them in the cockpit. Some researchers are finding that this technology should not replace the gauges but should work with them.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Boeing and Airbus are the two largest aircraft manufacturers of passenger jets and take very different approaches to the relationship between humans and technology. Airbus gives the flight computer much of the decision-making power in the cockpit, while Boeing has a different view. Its philosophy is to provide enough information to pilots so that they can make decisions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The final report for the Turkish Airlines tragedy blames the failure of technology as the cause. The failure of the radio altimeter was never uncovered, and the Dutch investigation has asked Boeing to improve the reliability of the system. The report also blames the crew for not noticing that their speed was dropping dangerously. Finally, the Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 accident raises the question, "Are cockipts becoming too complex?”</p>
