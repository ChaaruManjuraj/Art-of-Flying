      <h4>Cybersecurity Engineer, Aviation Enthusiast</h4>

      <p>As a computer engineer with a strong interest in aviation, I have honed my passion and knowledge through years of self-study and research. My fascination with aviation first took root in high school when I was introduced to the Microsoft Flight Simulator X simulation game. Over the course of several years, I devoted my own time to learning basic piloting techniques and familiarizing myself with various aircraft cockpits.</p>
      <p>Through my studies, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the on-board operations and procedures for a wide range of aircraft, including the Boeing 737, 747, 787, and 767, as well as the Airbus A310, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380, among others. Additionally, I have familiarized myself with aircraft such as the AirCreation 582L Trike Ultralight, the Beechcraft Baron 58, the Beechcraft King Air 350, and several others.</p>
      <p>Combining my passion for aviation and my expertise in computer engineering, I am currently researching the use of human-computer interaction with on-board sensors in future generation aircrafts. I am confident that this combination of interests will allow me to make valuable contributions to the field of aviation and aeronautics.</p>
