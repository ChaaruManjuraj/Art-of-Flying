      <h4>Cybersecurity Engineer, Aviation Enthusiast</h4>

      <p>I am a Computer Engineer with a passion for Aviation. My interest in aviation developed in high school when my cousin sister introduced me to a Simulation Game called 'Microsoft Flight Simulator X'. From then, I started growing my interest and passion in the field of aviation, aeronautics and piloting.</p>
      <p>I learnt basic piloting techniques and researched about it in my own time of 3-4 years. I learnt most of the on-board piloting operations and procedures, without touching any controls physically. Today, I am familiar with the cockpits of:</p>

        <li>AIRBUS A310, A320, A330, A340, A350, A380</li>

      <p>Connecting both my passion and work, I am researching about HCI with on-board sensors of future generation aircrafts.</p>
